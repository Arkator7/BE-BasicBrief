Additional Notes:

- Javascript
	- Javascript is a client-side scripting language
	- Is used by majority of websites
	- Allows flexible programming
		- Variables don't need to be assigned types (can be abstract)
	- Interpreted language, do not need a complier

- D3
	- JavaScript library for producing dynamic, interactive data visualizations in web browsers
	- Used to read CSV file and create table for data
	
- InMemory loading of CSV
	- Data can be used directly instead of putting data into storage, then extracting the stored data.

- Alternative
	- Data can be stored in a tree structure (10 branches), for ease of retrieval in the future
		- Although searching a tree tends to be faster, trees can be time consuming to set up.
	- Hash tables can be fast to search and insert
		- Storage can take up space
		
- Outstanding Issues
	- I'm still unable to establish a server to evade the CORS error, therefore the file source path is still set as static.
